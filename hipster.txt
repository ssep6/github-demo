I wish weekends felt more like weekends and less like days where Iâ€™m not financially obligated to sit at my computer. I need something relaxing, but everything rn is stressful and weird.

Usually, when Iâ€™m feeling stressed, I take a few days off, pack the dogs and Sarah into the Jeep, and head out to Palm Springs or Pismo Beach. Donâ€™t really have that luxury right now.

I guess I need to upend my routine or something. ðŸ¤”
