I wish weekends felt more like weekends and less like days where I’m not financially obligated to sit at my computer. I need something relaxing, but everything rn is stressful and weird.

Usually, when I’m feeling stressed, I take a few days off, pack the dogs and Sarah into the Jeep, and head out to Palm Springs or Pismo Beach. Don’t really have that luxury right now.

I guess I need to upend my routine or something. 🤔
We’ve got a war on our hands, people.

The springtime gophers that have taken up residence in our back yard have been going off this year. When I woke up this morning, I found at least four new mounds of varying sizes scattered about.

Last year, a heavy blanket of Uncle Ian’s all over our yard took care of them. But I checked the garage a few days ago, and found that I maybe have enough to funnel into each one of their mounds before flattening them back out.

That’ll keep them away for a minute, but I’m definitely going to need to order more repellent. Maybe a sonic spike or two. 🤔

Heaven forbid I have to go full Caddyshack on their lil asses…We’ve got a war on our hands, people.
